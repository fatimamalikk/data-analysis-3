##### Introduction:
This report uses the **Accountants and auditors** occupation groupfrom the [cps-earnings dataset](https://osf.io/g8p9j/) to build four predictive models using linear regression for earnings per hour. The BIC, RMSE, and five-fold cross-validation for cross-validated RMSE is calculated to discuss the relationship between model complexity and performance.

##### Data Cleaning, Exploration, and Factoring:
Age is modeled as its squared non-linearity for a regression with log hourly wage as the dependent variable. The following subset of predictor variables are considered for the purpose of this analysis: education level (Bachelor degree as base), age (squared), sex (male as base), number of children (squared and cubic), and marital status (not married as base). *Refer to Appendix for further details.*
